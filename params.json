{"name":"BYU Bomberman","tagline":"ECEn Bomberman | BYU","body":"### Welcome to BYU's Bomberman Display Page.\r\nThis project was created to serve as a new Computer Engineering-focused display\r\nfor new student orientation, SOAR, major fairs, etc.  It provides a fun, \r\ninteractive way to learn about circuits, I/O, and processing.  It connects the\r\nreal world to a digital one in a clever way.\r\n\r\nThis project is teaching about Computer Interfaces.  It involves low-level hardware\r\nand signal processing, high-level operating systems and software, and allows\r\nstudents to see how they can create powerful systems with computers.\r\n\r\nWe use a MaKeyMaKey board to allow students to create their own \"controllers\"\r\nto use with the game, and then use this as input to our Raspberry Pi, which \r\nruns Bombermaaan and outputs to the display.\r\n\r\n### How To Play\r\n 1. Grab the Bomberman Cart + Posters\r\n 2. Plug it in\r\n 3. Hook up all the controllers\r\n 4. Play!\r\n 5. When you're done, shutdown the Pi before unplugging the cart. (Instructions below).\r\n\r\n### Want the Nitty-Gritty Details?\r\nIf you want to view the real details of this project.
